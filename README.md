# Having a BLAST in Rust

## Introduction
The challenge of this project was to implement the BLAST algorithm. This project had 3 main goals:
1. To learn about the Rust programming language and gain some experience actually using the language. I've dabbled with Rust in the past, but I wanted to build something more challenging than a simple Hello World program. 
2. To learn about sequencing genomics data. I find Biological Sciences to be highly facinating, and I think computers are the tool that will facilitate the most breakthroughs in research in the future. 
3. Lastly, I had some other APIs I needed to learn about (or continue learning about), and I thought this would be an interesting project to allow me to learn things like D3.js, and continue working with the Spark framework.
